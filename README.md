  ## INSIGHTS
  Most subscribers prefer the basic subcription pattern, there may be a need for the company to carry out a survey among its customer to identify the reason for their choices.
  The Management of the company is advised to award incentives to staffers in the East Region as there was no subscription cancellation from this region. The  Company may also need to understudy the Region to     gain insights on the retention of subscribers vis-a-vis implementing any notable positive trend in the other regions.
  Moreover, considering the rate of cancellation at 44.91% , there is an urgent need for the company to implement customer friendly packages to improve Customer retention.
